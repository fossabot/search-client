## About

The SearchClient library makes it easy to hook up your search-UI to an IntelliSearch SearchService. 

The package handles all the backend web-services so that you can focus on the user interface instead. 

The SearchClient wraps and manages all the IntelliSearch SearchService REST web-services:

* Autocomplete - Lookups query-text and suggests words to help write the query.
* Find - Searches the index based on the current query (query-text, filters, ...).
* Categorize - Generates a category tree with counts based on the current query (query-text, filters, ...).

In addition, there are two other incomplete or experimental REST-interfaces exposed:

* BestBets [incomplete] - Does not yet expose a full resource based interface for creating, reading, updating and deleting best-bet records. For now, only allows getting a list of all registered best-bets.
* AllCategories [experimental] - Generates the full tree of categories (for the current user and for all words in the index). Note: This interface is disabled by default in the SearchService. In order to use this feature in the SearchClient you will need to enable this in the SearchService.exe.config on the server.

## Use in NPM projects

For projects that consumes npm packages natively you add this package as you would add any other npm-package: 

    > npm install --save search-client

If you are using typescript, then the datatypes are available for your IDE to use. If not, then all types and definitions are available in the generated API-documentation in the search-client doc-folder (typically ./node_modules/search-client/doc/index.html).

## Use in browser (via script-tag)

For web-pages that needs to have a script-tag embedded you can fetch the file(s) needed via the jsdelivr cdn, like this: 

    <script src="//cdn.jsdelivr.net/search-client/{version}/SearchClient.bundle.min.js"></script>
    
\- where `{version}` is to be replaced with the actual version you want. 


**CDN version aliases:**

We strongly recommend that you use the full version id for production sites. For development sites we do recommend the same, but we also see that using a version alias might be handy in some cases.

* `latest`\
  You **can** use the jsdelivr version alias `latest` to always just get the latest version. Just be warned that your site is at high risk of breaking when new versions of the search-client are released. If the search-client library is updated and somehow is no longer compatible with your code, then your site will potentially break and stop working.

* `<Major>` (i.e. `1`)\
  This means that it will get the latest version for the given major version. Note that the same warning as for `latest` applies, although this is less risky than just getting any `latest` version.

* `<Major.Minor>` (i.e. `1.1`)\
  This means that it will get the latest version for the given major.minor version. Note that the same warning as for `latest` applies, although this is less risky than both of the above options.

**Note:** A benefit to using the npm system is the inclusion of `map`-files. Next to the browser-bundles in the project you can find accompanying `.map` files that browsers are able to utilize in order to give a better debugging experience.
